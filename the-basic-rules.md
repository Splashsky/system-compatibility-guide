### The basic rules.

First of all, there's a couple basic rules that need to be set down for compatibility between ADT-supported systems.

* **Not all manufacturers are the same**. To put it simply, when switching from one manufacturer (e.g. GE/ITI) to another (e.g. DSC/Ademco) you may have discrepancies that can't initially be accounted for. Most of the guide should still be applicable!
* **RF (wireless) signals aren't made the same**. This is to say that even with an RF to RF Flex translator you may not be able to switch one wireless system to another. See rule below.
* **Contact/motion detector technology hasn't changed in over a decade**. Really! The technology behind contacts and motion detectors in personal security systems have remained the same for many years. Rest assured that most contacts and detectors will be compatible.
* **It's a matter of responsibility to replace life safety devices**. Life safety devices are important. Fire detectors save lives and entire communities. You can't take a risk on a life safety device not being compatible; make sure to replace them when and where necessary.

And without further ado, we can jump right into the guide!
