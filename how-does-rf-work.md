### How does RF (wireless) work?

RF devices are really big in the security industry these days. With how easily HW (hardwired) devices can be disabled by tampering with them, the entire market has seen a shift to the easier-to-install and more reliable wireless solutions available.

Each wireless device is equipped with a transmitter chip that sends out a wireless signal that the keypad is programmed to pick up. In the case of Ademco/Honeywell equipment, the standard is 5800-series wireless signals. Other manufacturers, such as DSC, only specify their typical frequency, which tends to be 433MHz. Don't worry about the fancy terms here; we'll only worry about actual functionality.

Even with security systems now being wireless and running off of radio frequencies, these devices are often encrypted, secured and programmed only to work with each other. There are incredibly few and far between cases of wireless home security systems being compromised.

You may think that DSC/GE/ITI/Honeywell wireless contacts are all different and can't work in sync, and you'd be right! However, there are work arounds. See the next section.
