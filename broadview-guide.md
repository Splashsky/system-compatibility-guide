### Okay, so what about BV (BroadView) systems?

BroadView was a company acquired by ADT in 2010, and since then they've supported the old BroadView systems (typically the BV3000 or BV4000) and provided warranty on them. As a preference, we prefer to upgrade these directly to the Safewatch Pro 3000 (P3K) system, select the RF configuration and include an HW to RF Flex.

The BV4000 is compatible with cellular units and should always be upgraded to use them when you have the chance. Anything older than a BV4000 such as the BV1000 to the BV3000 should be upgraded to a P3K system without question.

When upgrading these systems to wireless, **always** replace the fire and carbon detectors.

Here's a quick rundown of the BV4000 system; other versions have been ommitted for space and time.

#### BroadView 4000
* Supports 1 master code and up to 91 additional user codes
* Has 3 manual panic buttons (police, fire, medical)
* Can be operated by any phone with touchtone capability
* Supports both cellular and Internet modules
* The volume cannot be changed on the panel

You should always attempt to upgrade these to the Safewatch family of systems, or even the ADT Total Security unit. Use the P3K's RF configuration, and use an HW to RF Flex translator. If they don't want a system upgrade, at least have a cellular/Internet module installed.
