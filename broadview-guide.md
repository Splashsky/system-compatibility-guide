### Okay, so what about BV (BroadView) systems?

BroadView was a company acquired by ADT in 2010, and since then they've supported the old BroadView systems (typically the BV3000 or BV4000) and provided warranty on them. As a preference, we prefer to upgrade these directly to the SafeWatch Pro 3000 (P3K) system, select the RF configuration and include an HW to RF Flex.

The BV4000 is compatible with cellular units and should always be upgraded to use them when you have the chance. Anything older than a BV4000 such as the BV1000 to the BV3000 should be upgraded to a P3K system without question.

When upgrading these systems to wireless, **always** replace the fire and carbon detectors.
