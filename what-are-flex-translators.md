### What are Flex translators?

The Flex (short for Flexible) translator is a component for the computer portion of a security system that translates the digital (or sometimes mechanical) signals between RF (wireless) and RF devices or even HW (hardwired) and RF devices.

Unfortunately, Flex translators and even the aforementioned adapter don't work in reverse. You can't adapt RF contacts down to HW to contacts, since turning a digital signal into an analog one is beyond the scope of technology supported in home security systems.

The only listed RF to RF Flex translator is the RE524X. It's a unit that's adaptable for all situations where you need to convert wireless signals, such as DSC's 433MHz to Honeywell's 5800-series.

For HW to RF conversions, you have the tried-and-true Honeywell 5800C2W, which - as it's part number implies - converts up to 9 HW devices to use 5800-series signals. Alternatively, you have the more adaptable Ecolink WST-802, which converts up to 8 HW devices to variable wireless signals, including 5800-series and 433MHz.
