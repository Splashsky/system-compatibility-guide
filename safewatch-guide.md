# What's up with Safewatch?

The Safewatch family of systems are incredibly popular and widespread. Easily one of ADT's most reliable and tested systems, the Safewatch Pro 3000 (P3K) and even it's earlier cousins have been used for decades to secure homes and businesses alike.

With this guide, we'll focus on the most popular and common version; the Safewatch Pro 3000, or P3K. The P3K comes in four configurations and two versions. It also has support for smart home solutions such as Pulse, and iCenter touchscreen keypads. It's four configurations are a standard dixed display which doesn't talk or have a system message center; a "custom" English version that talks and has a message center; the Safepass version (read below) and finally the touchscreen version which talks and has a visual system message center.

By system message center, I'm talking about the fact the system will have a log of activity on the system available to the user. By talking, I mean the system can speak and tell you which zones are open and what status the system is in. The Safepass version allows the user to have small RF (wireless) tags called Safepass Tags that they can touch the system with to arm and disarm it.

By far the most popular two configurations are the fixed and "custom" editions.

There's not a lot of upgrading to do to these systems, honestly. An RF receiver and a HW to RF translator would be great if the customer only has HW (hardwired) devices. Smart home technologies would boost it's value a bunch. You can upgrade it to more modern touchscreen solutions such as ADT's Total Security system, too. As always, if the customer is still exclusively using a landline then definitely push to put in a cellular or Internet-based module.

Here's a quick overview of the Safewatch Pro 3000 system!

#### Safewatch Pro 3000
* Supports up to 64 zones, 48 of which are reserved for contacts and detectors, the last 15 of which are generally for keyfobs.
* Sports up to 49 user codes; a surprising drop from it's predecessor's 91.
* Has a feature called Latchkey; parents can set a timer for when they expect their kids to come home and disarm the system. Parents can be notified if this doesn't occur.
* The system itself can be programmed to control lights from the keypad.
* This system is also capable of being controlled by calling the home phone number, if the system is connected to that number.
* It can also be programmed to arm/disarm itself at times set by the user.

In general, most of these systems are HW. You should always look into getting the customer set up wirelessly and upgraded to user cellular or Internet-based connections. You can also look into the touchscreen offerings, since everyone likes tablet-like keypads! Since this system is so reliable, there's not much to look out for. Truly a system of choice nationwide.
