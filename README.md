## What is this?

This small webpage is the result of months of research and experience working with security systems that [ADT](https://adt.com) supports, as well as knowledge gleaned from internal resources. This is to act more as a primer or a guide than an official rulebook.

Information in this guide are subject to change, as I always try to get feedback from agents and techs that may know the subject matter more than myself. As such, ensure you're keeping up to date!

Please note that Ademco and Honeywell can and will be used interchangeably throughout this guide.
