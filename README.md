## What is this?

This small webpage is the result of months of research and experience working with security systems that [ADT](https://adt.com) supports, as well as knowledge gleaned from internal resources. This is to act more as a primer or a guide than an official rulebook.

Information in this guide are subject to change, as I always try to get feedback from agents and techs that may know the subject matter more than myself. As such, ensure you're keeping up to date!

Please note that Ademco and Honeywell can and will be used interchangeably throughout this guide.

### The basic rules.

First of all, there's a couple basic rules that need to be set down for compatibility between ADT-supported systems.

* **Not all manufacturers are the same**. To put it simply, when switching from one manufacturer (e.g. GE/ITI) to another (e.g. DSC/Ademco) you may have discrepancies that can't initially be accounted for. Most of the guide should still be applicable!
* **RF (wireless) signals aren't made the same**. This is to say that even with an RF to RF Flex translator you may not be able to switch one wireless system to another. See rule below.
* **Contact/motion detector technology hasn't changed in over a decade**. Really! The technology behind contacts and motion detectors in personal security systems have remained the same for many years. Rest assured that most contacts and detectors will be compatible.
* **It's a matter of responsibility to replace life safety devices**. Life safety devices are important. Fire detectors save lives and entire communities. You can't take a risk on a life safety device not being compatible; make sure to replace them when and where necessary.

And without further ado, we can jump right into the guide!

### How does RF (wireless) work?

RF devices are really big in the security industry these days. With how easily HW (hardwired) devices can be disabled by tampering with them, the entire market has seen a shift to the easier-to-install and more reliable wireless solutions available.

Each wireless device is equipped with a transmitter chip that sends out a wireless signal that the keypad is programmed to pick up. In the case of Ademco/Honeywell equipment, the standard is 5800-series wireless signals. Other manufacturers, such as DSC, only specify their typical frequency, which tends to be 433MHz. Don't worry about the fancy terms here; we'll only worry about actual functionality.

Now, this may tell you that DSC/GE/ITI/Honeywell wireless contacts are all different and can't work in sync, and you'd be right! However, there are work arounds. See the section below.

### What are Flex translators?

The Flex (short for Flexible) translator is a component for the computer portion of a security system that translates the digital (or sometimes mechanical) signals between RF (wireless) and RF devices or even HW (hardwired) and RF devices.

Unfortunately, Flex translators and even the aforementioned adapter don't work in reverse. You can't adapt RF contacts down to HW to contacts, since turning a digital signal into an analog one is beyond the scope of technology supported in home security systems.

The only listed RF to RF Flex translator is the RE524X. It's a unit that's adaptable for all situations where you need to convert wireless signals, such as DSC's 433MHz to Honeywell's 5800-series.

For HW to RF conversions, you have the tried-and-true Honeywell 5800C2W, which - as it's part number implies - converts up to 9 HW devices to use 5800-series signals. Alternatively, you have the more adaptable Ecolink WST-802, which converts up to 8 HW devices to variable wireless signals, including 5800-series and 433MHz.
